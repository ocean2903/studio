## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to evoke trust and stability, given the data-centric nature of the app. The hue evokes data and the future. The depth helps ensure readability on a light background.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5), to provide a clean and neutral backdrop that highlights the charts without causing distraction. The hue is similar to the primary, but is far less saturated and far brighter.
- Accent color: A slightly violet color (#673AB7), used in hover states, buttons and progress bars.
- Clean and modern sans-serif font.
- Use a consistent and clear icon set, emphasizing simplicity and ease of understanding.
- The layout should provide clear visual hierarchy, and aim for ease of navigation and data access.
- Subtle transitions and animations on user interactions.
